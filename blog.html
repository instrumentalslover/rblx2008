	<div class="storycontent">
		<p>Howdy! Today&#8217;s article is for Roblox power users who want to learn how to develop scripts in Roblox. This is not a programming language tutorial - I will assume you know enough about Lua to look at a piece of code and guess at what it does. Rather I am going to teach you how to deal with buggy scripts and show how to debug them. Debugging in general is a mystical art - I use the word &quot;art&quot;, which is the product of innate creative forces, in contrast to &quot;science&quot;, which can be dissected, reduced, and taught. We&#8217;ve built some tools into Roblox Studio to help you though.</p>
<p><strong>Part 1 - Mission Statement</strong></p>
<p>We&#8217;re going to build a secret door. An easy way to make a secret door is to make a brick and set its CanCollide property to false. Anyone can them walk through such a brick. No. Our secret door is going to be special. It&#8217;s eventually going to guard the treasure room in my castle and it&#8217;s only going to let approved members of the Pirate Army through (Arrrrr!). Clearly we need some scripting here, me hearties.</p>
<p><strong>Part 2 - Build From Simpler Pieces</strong></p>
<p>When I&#8217;m making a complicated script, I try to test it as I go along. I&#8217;ve seen a lot of people in intro programming classes try to write all their code at once and then test it. This is about the most painful way to write code. Don&#8217;t do it. Instead, write the shortest bit of code that you can test. Test it. If it works, add some more stuff. Then test it. If something broke, you know where to start looking.</p>
<p>A more simple version of the door we want to make is a door that just turns transparent whenever anything touches it.</p>
<p><a class="imagelink" title="simpledoor1.png" href="https://web.archive.org/web/20080701004156/http://blog.roblox.com/wp-content/uploads/2007/02/simpledoor1.png"><img id="image77" height="96" alt="simpledoor1.png" src="https://web.archive.org/web/20080701004156im_/http://blog.roblox.com/wp-content/uploads/2007/02/simpledoor1.thumbnail.png"/></a>Go ahead and open up Roblox Studio. Create a simple test level, like the one pictured. In my level, the first test door is red. Use the Insert -&gt; Object menu to insert a script under your test door (when the dialog box pops up, type the word &quot;Script&quot;). Do yourself a favor and give the script a descriptive name like &quot;DoorScript&quot;.</p>
<p><strong>Part 3 - Power Tools</strong></p>
<p>Ok, time to break out the power tools. If you have been scripting without these, I feel sorry for you. There are two that I will talk about today: the Output window and the Command toolbar. The first is by far the most useful, so I will focus on it.</p>
<p>To bring up the Output window, use the View -&gt; Output menu option. This is add a window pane to the bottom of your screen. This window will show the output from your scripts while they are running. If your script has an error in it, the error will be printed here along with the line number telling you where the script broke. Let&#8217;s look at both of these right now. In your new script, paste the following code:</p>
<blockquote><p>print(&quot;Hello world!&quot;)</p>
<p>for i=1,10 do     <br/> print(i)      <br/>end</p>
<p>script.ThisPropertyDoesNotExist = 6</p>
</blockquote>
<p>As you can probably tell, this script prints &quot;Hello world!&quot;, spits out the numbers 1 to 10 and then crashes on an error. If you press the Run button in Studio, you can see this. The output will look like this:</p>
<blockquote><p>Tue Feb 13 15:56:07 2007 - Script Heap Stats: Max Size = 21945 bytes, Max Count = 401 blocks     <br/>Hello world!      <br/>1      <br/>2      <br/>3      <br/>4      <br/>5      <br/>6      <br/>7      <br/>8      <br/>9      <br/>10      <br/>Tue Feb 13 15:56:16 2007 - ThisPropertyDoesNotExist is not a valid member of Script - =Workspace.Script, line 7: (null)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This is telling us that line 7 of our script is bad, which is something we already knew. However, in a more complicated script, it can be very helpful to print out stuff as the script is running so that you can see where things are going wrong. It may seem obvious once I&#8217;ve said it, but if something is broken with your script, start printing stuff out - rare is the bug that will not succumb to this level of scrutiny. I once wrote an entire operating system, using only printf to debug it.</p>
<p><a class="imagelink" title="commandtoolbar.png" href="https://web.archive.org/web/20080701004156/http://blog.roblox.com/wp-content/uploads/2007/02/commandtoolbar.png"><img id="image76" height="34" alt="commandtoolbar.png" src="https://web.archive.org/web/20080701004156im_/http://blog.roblox.com/wp-content/uploads/2007/02/commandtoolbar.thumbnail.png"/></a>I started programming when I was in 2nd grade and a popular language to learn back then was something called QBASIC - some of you may know it. One feature of the QBASIC programming environment was something called the Immediate Window, which you could type code into and immediately see it execute. On occasion this can be helpful to debug a script <em>while it is running</em>. However, this is more for advanced users. You can bring up Roblox Studio&#8217;s equivalent of the Immediate Window by using the View -&gt; Toolbars -&gt; Command menu option to bring up the Command Toolbar. You can type code into this at any time and run it. For example, if you wanted to, you could type:</p>
<blockquote><p>game.Workspace.Door.Position = Vector3.new(0,100,0)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>And if you have a part named &quot;Door&quot; in your level, it will be immediately teleported to (0, 100 ,0) while the game is running. This is kindof arcane, but I mention it because I have found the Command Toolbar useful on occasion.</p>
<p><strong>Part 4 - Simple Door Script</strong></p>
<p>Here it is:</p>
<blockquote><p>print(&quot;Simple Secret Door Script Loaded&quot;)</p>
<p>Door = script.Parent</p>
<p>function onTouched(hit)     <br/>&#160; <br/>&#160; print(&quot;Door Hit&quot;)      <br/>&#160; Door.Transparency = .5      <br/>&#160; wait(5)      <br/>&#160; Door.Transparency = 0</p>
<p>end</p>
<p>connection = Door.Touched:connect(onTouched)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>If you have ever seriously tried to learn lua scripting for Roblox, you have looked at some Roblox scripts. The code for listening to a Touch event should look familiar. Basically I have wired up the Part.Touched event to call the onTouched function whenever the part is touched by another part. When this happens, the door will turn semi-transparent for 5 seconds. Add this to your Door script, save your map, and try it. If you touch or shoot the door, you will see a nice effect. If you have the Output Window up, you will also see a &quot;Door Hit&quot; message printed whenever the door is touched. If you did not see this message, you would know that the onTouch function was not being called and that you had not wired up the event handler correctly.</p>
<p><strong>Part 5 - A More Complicated Door</strong></p>
<p>Like I said, this is not a tutorial on actually writing code, only debugging it. So here is the finished script:</p>
<blockquote><p>print(&quot;Advanced SpecialDoor Script loaded&quot;)</p>
<p>&#8212; list of account names allowed to go through the door.     <br/>permission = { &quot;Telamon&quot;, &quot;PirateArmy&quot;, &quot;CaptainMorgan&quot;, &quot;SilverShanks&quot;, &quot;JackRackam&quot; }      <br/>Door = script.Parent</p>
<p>function checkOkToLetIn(name)     <br/> for i = 1,#permission do      <br/>&#160; &#8212; convert strings to all upper case, otherwise we will let in      <br/>&#160; &#8212; &quot;Telamon&quot; but not &quot;telamon&quot; or &quot;tELAMON&quot;      <br/>&#160; if (string.upper(name) == string.upper(permission[i])) then return true end      <br/> end      <br/> return false      <br/>end</p>
<p>function onTouched(hit)     <br/>&#160; print(&quot;Door Hit&quot;)      <br/>&#160; local human = hit.Parent.FindFirstChild(&quot;Humanoid&quot;)      <br/>&#160; if (human ~= nil ) then      <br/>&#160;&#160; &#8212; a human has touched this door!      <br/>&#160;&#160; print(&quot;Human touched door&quot;)      <br/>&#160;&#160; &#8212; test the human&#8217;s name against the permission list      <br/>&#160;&#160; if (checkOkToLetIn(human.Parent.Name)) then      <br/>&#160;&#160;&#160; print(&quot;Human passed test&quot;)      <br/>&#160;&#160;&#160; Door.Transparency = .5      <br/>&#160;&#160;&#160; Door.CanCollide = false      <br/>&#160;&#160;&#160; wait(7)      <br/>&#160;&#160;&#160; Door.CanCollide = true      <br/>&#160;&#160;&#160; Door.Transparency = 0      <br/>&#160;&#160; end      <br/>&#160; end</p>
<p>end</p>
<p>connection = Door.Touched:connect(onTouched)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>It has one bug in it. Without using the Output Window, the only thing you will be able to tell is that the script is not working. With the Output Window, the problem becomes obvious:</p>
<blockquote><p>Advanced SpecialDoor Script loaded     <br/>Simple Secret Door Script Loaded      <br/>Door Hit      <br/>Tue Feb 13 16:44:19 2007 - Workspace.YellowDoor.DoorScript2:18: bad argument #1 to &#8216;findFirstChild&#8217; (Instance expected, got string) -</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Since the script prints out &quot;Door Hit&quot;, but not &quot;Human touched door&quot;, we know the problem is somewhere in line 18 or 19 of the code. The Output window tells us that there is a problem on line 18 - FindFirstChild is failing. Ah! That is because in Lua methods are invoked using a colon (:) instead of a dot (.) (all other languages of consequence use dots for this - curse the inventors of Lua!) Change the line 18 to be:</p>
<blockquote><p>local human = hit.Parent:FindFirstChild(&quot;Humanoid&quot;)</p>
</blockquote>

To see it in action, check out <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20080701004156/http://www.roblox.com/user.aspx?id=14751" target="_blank">SpecialDoor&#8217;s Place</a>. If you are a new scripter and you are looking for some projects to work on, here are some easy adaptations of this script that you could do:</p>
<p>&#160;</p>
<ol>
<li>Make the door let in everyone <em>except</em> those people who are on a blacklist (this is the opposite of the current door). </li>
<li>Make the door flash different colors while it is open. </li>
<li>Make the door heal you as you walk through it.</li>
</ol>

We&#8217;re going to put them to work cranking out great stuff for you guys, and giving me rides around the office in my wheely chair. So you guys do your part and give them all a warm welcome, and I&#8217;ll do my part and make sure the wheels on my chair are oiled up.<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20080701004156/http://www.alexquach.com/roblox/"><img height="125" alt="RBXHQ" src="https://web.archive.org/web/20080701004156im_/http://blog.roblox.com/wp-content/uploads/rbxhq.png" width="506"></a> </p>

	<div class="storycontent">
		<p>We&#8217;re having a YouTube movie contest and the theme is humor. Be sure to read all the guidelines below to make sure your funny YouTube movie gets entered.</p>
<p><strong>Prizes!</strong></p>
<p>There will be 5 (and only 5) winners for this event. They each will receive the Video Contest exclusive hat. They will also receive $R 300. There is no ranking among the five. All of them are winners.</p>
<p><strong>Rules</strong></p>
<p>1. Create a humorous ROBLOX video. You can learn how to make Roblox movies from our <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20080701004156/http://wiki.roblox.com/index.php?title=How_to_Make_Roblox_Movies">tutorial</a>.</p>
<p>2. Please make all videos suitable for viewing by kids, grandmas, school teachers, and your next door neighbor. No profanity or inappropriate images. Any video that breaks the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20080701004156/http://wiki.roblox.com/index.php?title=Community_Guidelines">standard ROBLOX rules</a> will not be able to win.</p>
<p>3. Videos should be between 30 seconds and 3 minutes long. Most of the footage should be ROBLOX related.</p>
<p>4. On your video page put the following information.</p>
<ul>
<li>1. Username
<li>2. Link to ROBLOX - <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20080701004156/http://www.roblox.com/">http://www.roblox.com</a>
<li>3. Tags - &#8220;ROBLOX&#8221; and &#8220;may-funny&#8221; </li>
</ul>
<p>5. Contest Closes <strong>Monday June 9 at 6pm Pacific time (9pm Eastern)</strong>. All videos must be posted by this time.</p>
<p>7. Winners and prizes will be announced within a week of the contest close.</p>
<p><strong>How To Win</strong></p>
<p>The winners will be chosen by the ROBLOX Team who will search for videos with all the right things. Videos must have been uploaded since the contest started (no old videos!), must have the right links and tags, must have your username.</p>
<p>Most of all they must be funny! The ROBLOX Team will watch the highest rated and watched videos and pick the ones they think are most funny. This contest is subjective to the Team&#8217;s humor. Not everyone will agree that your video is funny, but we hope it is too!</p>
<blockquote><p>Extra Rules:</p>
<p>Feel free to talk about your video on the forums and link to it. Don&#8217;t post more than once though!</p>
<p>Google videos will not be accepted. Only videos on YouTube will count for this event.</p>
<p>You can work in teams OF UP TO 3 PEOPLE. Each person in a winning team would get the hat, but the money would be split between you. All the team&#8217;s names must be listed on the YouTube video information.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>If this contest goes well we may have more of them in the future. We think it&#8217;s great how many videos there are about ROBLOX. You guys are so creative!</p>

	<div class="storycontent">
		<p>We received almost 4600 responses to the Getting To Know You survey. That&#8217;s great! Now we will be better able to understand the users. Thanks guys!</p>
<p>We learned some interesting things from the survey, like that most users really like chatting and playing games but not so much scripting. We will try to keep it all in mind for future updates. </p>
<p>We also got some great suggestions&#8230; </p>
<blockquote><p>I would love for ROBLOX to add an options menu&#8230; for example: when you talk you can change font color, there is chat above your head when you talk, you can change the quality from high to med/low, and you can do many other option things&#8230;</p>
<p>You can record videos on ROBLOX when you play. I mean it would come with a built in camera!!!!</p>
<p>Capes for our characters! </p>
<p>That players could rate a place, so other people could not get fooled by the name of the place.</p>
<p>When in a building game, make it be able so only you can delete your stuff, so people can&#8217;t come and delete it.</p>
<p>Some kind of hat, shirt, T-shirt, pants gifting system. Reason: to be nice to friends. I think to make it really friendly, it should be free and not just a BC thing.</p>
<p>Scripts in the Catalog for easier scripting.</p>
<p>I believe Roblox should add new kinds of basic meshes (e.g. Wedge) and new kinds of block shapes (e.g. Cylinder) and the ability to rotate and tilt bricks.</p>
<p><em>&#8230;as well as many suggestions for various hats, faces, and other costume changes.</em></p>
</blockquote>
<p>The following 50 users received $R 50 each. They were randomly chosen from the list of survey takers.</p>
